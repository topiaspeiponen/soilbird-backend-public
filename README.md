# soilbird-backend

Soilbird-backend is the back-end for a smart irrigation web controller application. Its basic premise is that it supposed to control irrigation devices, and receive soil sensor data via APIs. The irrigation control would include dynamic logic that changes depending on the measured soil moisture, which could also be controlled by the user. Smart irrigation is part of a larger project at the City of Helsinki's Sports and Leisure maintenance unit.  The "Soilbird" project was part of my bachelor's thesis, but unfortunately due to restrictions in manufacturers' API access, the project was cancelled at early stages.

The back-end was made in *Nest.js*
